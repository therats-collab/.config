# The Rats Config Stuff
Are you me? No? Proceed anyways, but be warned this is not well made at all.

## Cordless
Theme files for Cordless, a CLI Discord interface. Making your own is hard and complicated, so here are some I've made that I liked.
![Cordless Default](.github/images/cordless-default.png)
Easy on the eyes, has peach on dark purple text, and fuchsia accents.
![Spooky Cordless](.github/images/cordless-spooky.png)
Funky and only a little dated, has white on black text and orange accents.
